# Samosa Selector App

The Samosa Selector is a fun, interactive web application built with React. It allows users to accumulate "samosas" by clicking on an image of a samosa. Users can then spend their samosas on upgrades to increase the number of samosas they get per click. It's a simple clicker game that demonstrates the use of React state and event handling.

## Features

- Samosa Counter: Shows the current number of samosas you've accumulated.
- Click on Samosa: Each click on the samosa image adds a certain number of samosas to your count, based on your current multiplier.
- Upgrades:
    - Double Stuffed: Doubles the samosas per click.
    - Party Pack: Increases the samosas per click by five times.
    - Full Feast: Increases the samosas per click by ten times.
- Reset Button: Resets the count and multiplier back to the initial state.
